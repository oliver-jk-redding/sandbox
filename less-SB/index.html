	<h1>This is my Less Sandbox</h1>

	<p>Welcome to my Less sandbox where I learn how to use less. Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themeable and extendable.</p>
	<p>Less runs inside Node, in the browser and inside Rhino. There are also many 3rd party tools that allow you to compile your files and watch for changes. The quickest place for first experiments with less is our online editor.</p>

	<h4>I like less for the following reasons:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<div class='div'>really cool
				<div class='div'>how cool?</div>
			</div>
			<div class='div'>really really cool</div>
		</li>
		<li>It's whimsical<div class='div'>haha</div></li>
		<li>It helps me look like a l337 h@xor<div class='div'>733t</div></li>
		<li>Chuck Norris uses it</li>
	</ul>

	<div id='small-circle'></div>
	<div id='big-circle'></div>

	<div id='left'>This is div 1</div>
	<div id='right'>This is div 2</div>
	<div>This is div 3</div>

	<ul>
		<li><div class='div'>hi</div></li>
		<li><div class='div'>hello</div></li>
	</ul>
